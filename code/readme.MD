# Steam
With the time limit I had, the difficulty with Steam is you need to purchase an App Credit. It is $100. You must own the App Credit for 30 days before the Game can be published. I didn't know this. I bought the credit on July 18th, so August 17th was the earliest the game would be on Steam. That was the day before the conference! Additionally, the game must be packaged and approved with the store listing submitted for two weeks for customers to see as "coming soon" before release. I handled this by creating an incredibly simple first version of the game and submitting it right away to all the stores. The game is an HTML5 PWA, so I could change it later after working out compliance and policy issues with Apple and Google. Steam would be more difficult so I would need to stay on top of it for the month so that at least a compiled Electron version hit Steam at least two weeks before August 17th.
