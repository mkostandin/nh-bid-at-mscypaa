# Steam
The difficulty with Steam is you need to purchase an App Credit. It is $100. You must own the App Credit for 30 days before Game can be published. I didn't know this. I bought the credit on July 18th so August 17th was the earliest the game would be on Steam. That was the day before the conference! Additionally, the game must be packaged and approved with the store listing submitted for two weeks before release.
